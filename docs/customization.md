## BYOD: Bring Your Own Dataset

**But of course!**

This guide will walk you through how to use the existing codebase to adapt it to your own unique dataset with minimal effort.

The idea is to load and pre-process your own dataset in the same format as the existing datasets, allowing you to seamlessly integrate with the `finetune_whisper.py` script.

### Step 1: Understand your Dataset

Before creating your custom dataset loading function, it's essential to understand the data format that the `finetune_whisper.py` script expects. Typically, the dataset should have a structure that looks a bit like this:

```python
{
    "train": [
        {
            "audio": "path/to/audio_file.wav",
            "text": "The transcribed text of the audio"
        },
        # More examples...
    ],
    "test": [
        {
            "audio": "path/to/audio_file_2.wav",
            "text": "Another transcribed text"
        },
        # More examples...
    ]
}
```

Notably, there should be a pair of transcribed text and an audio clip (usually in the form of a path to the audio file, either `.mp3` or `.wav`)

### Step 2: Create a *load_my_dataset* Function

Next, you'll create a custom dataset loading function and place it inside `data_process.py`. This function will load and pre-process your dataset into the expected format and return an HuggingFace `DatasetDict` containing two `Dataset` objects like so: `train`:`Dataset` and `test`:`Dataset` for each split respectively.

As an example, lets consider that you have a directory with a csv file and all the audio clips like this:

```
datasets/
├── my_dataset/
│   ├── dataset.csv
│   └── audio_files/
│       ├── audio_1.wav
│       ├── audio_2.wav
│       ├── audio_3.wav
│       └── ...
```
and that the .csv file has the following format:

```csv my_dataset/dataset.csv
audio,text
example_1.mp3,"This is an example"
example_2.mp3,"This is another example"
...
example_n.mp3,"This is yet another example"
```

**Example function**
```
import os
import pandas as pd
from datasets import Dataset, DatasetDict
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split


def load_my_dataset(my_dataset_dir: str = "/home/user/datasets/my_dataset", train_split: float = 0.8) -> DatasetDict:
    """
    Load and process your custom dataset from the given directory.

    Args:
        my_dataset_dir (str): Path to the directory containing your dataset.
        train_split (float): Percentage of data to use for training. The rest will be used for evaluation as a test set.

    Returns:
        DatasetDict: HF Dataset dictionary that consists of two distinct Datasets (train and test)
    """
    # Define the path to the CSV file
    csv_path = os.path.join(my_dataset_dir, "dataset.csv")
    df = pd.read_csv(csv_path)

    # Only keep the columns we need and drop any other possible metadata columns
    df = df.select_columns(["audio", "sentence"])

    # Our processing script expects the column with the transcribed text to be called "sentence"
    df = df.rename(columns={"text": "sentence"})

    # Replace the relative path to the audio clip with the absolute path
    df["audio"] = df["audio"].apply(lambda p: f"{my_dataset_dir}/audio_files/{p}")

    # Split the DataFrame into train and test sets and set a seed to shuffle and easily reproduce
    train_df, test_df = train_test_split(df, train_size=train_split, random_state=42)

    # Return the DatasetDict containing the train and test datasets
    return DatasetDict({
        "train": Dataset.from_pandas(train_df),
        "test": Dataset.from_pandas(test_df)
    })

```

### Step 3: Integrate with the rest of the codebase

Once you've created your custom dataset loading function, you need to integrate it into the existing codebase. Specifically, you need to update the `load_dataset_from_dataset_id` function in [data_process.py](../src/speech_to_text_finetune/data_process.py) to include the new function. Simply add to the function:


```
    try:
        dataset = load_my_dataset(dataset_id)
        return dataset, _get_local_proc_dataset_path(dataset_id)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        pass
```

### Step 4: Update your config file

Don't forget to update your config file so that the `dataset_id` points to the right directory path:

```
model_id: openai/whisper-tiny
dataset_id: /home/user/datasets/my_dataset
...
```


### Step 5: Fine-Tune the model with your own dataset!

Finally, simply run the finetune_whisper.py script to fine-tune the Whisper model using your custom dataset.

```
python src/speech_to_text_finetune/finetune_whisper.py
```
